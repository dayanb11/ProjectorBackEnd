# Place your React frontend files in this directory

## Integration Steps:

1. Copy your React project files into the `frontend/` directory
2. Make sure your React app builds to `frontend/build/` directory
3. Update your React app's API calls to use the backend URL
4. Run `npm run start:fullstack` to build and serve both frontend and backend

## Frontend Configuration:

Your React app should make API calls to:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:4000/api`
- Auth endpoints: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/refresh`, `/api/auth/logout`
- Workers endpoints: `/api/workers`
- Programs endpoints: `/api/programs`

## Environment Variables for React:

Create a `.env` file in your React app with:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```
